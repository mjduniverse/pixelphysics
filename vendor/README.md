This is PPG Sploder Emulator. It is used to run games on Sploder created with the Physics Puzzle Creator.

### Not a port

This is not a port of the Physics engine of the PPG engine. It does not use any code that was orginally used in the physics creator engine. Rather, it merely emulates.

### On music and inbuilt graphics

As of now, this emulator does not include the music that is used on Sploder for licensing reasons. The same goes for inbuilt graphics (such as the angry face for baddies and the smiling face for the player).
