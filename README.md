Pixelphysics is an emulator that plays games that were created by Sploder.com's Physics Puzzle Creator.

### Not a port

This is not a port of the Physics engine of the PPG engine. It does not use any code that was orginally used in the physics creator engine. Rather, it merely emulates by parsing the XML data for a game and runs the results using Matter.js and PhSim.

### On music and inbuilt graphics

As of now, this emulator does not include the music that is used on Sploder for licensing reasons. The same goes for inbuilt graphics (such as the angry face for baddies and the smiling face for the player).
